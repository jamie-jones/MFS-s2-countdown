# Motherland: Fort Salem Countdown

## About

The Motherland: Fort Salem Countdown is a website that counts down to every upcoming weekly episode with the entertainment of amazing artwork made by fans of the show. Starting off as a season two premiere countdown, we have continued to count down to each and every episode that comes out and continue to add more and more artwork and submitions we come across or are submitted to us via the website. Under the countdown, you will find three buttons: MFSRI Page, Get Featured, and Take Spec Quiz.

The first button "MFSRI Page" will open a separate tab to the Motherland: Fort Salem Research Institute's official Tumblr page, where you will find theory posts and can interract with the MFSRI Tumblr mod team.

The second button "Get Featured!" will open a separate tab to a google form where you will be able to submit a request for your own artwork to be added to the countdown!

The thrid button "Take Spec Quiz!" will open a tab to the [Motherland: Fort Salem Specialization Quiz](http://www.mfsquiz.com/), also created by me under the MFSRI R&D.
